         <h1>Living in California</h1>

         <p>I only lived in Long Beach, California for a brief four months but what I experienced there was enough for me to want to visit again. I didn't get
            to roam the city and experience a lot of it, apart from running around town to get my car registered. I did not get to try the famous In-N-Out Burger,
            but the few places I did get to try were pretty good. As I said, I didn't have too much time in Long Beach and most of it was trying to find a job.
            So, instead of places to go it's going to be places I wanted to go to.
